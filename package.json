This project and the accompanying YouTube videos is meant for junior developers who already have basic exposure to Node, Express, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am going to try to assume that you're not particularly comfortable with any of them though so I will explain a lot along the way. I'm going to assume you know nothing about PostgreSQL.",
